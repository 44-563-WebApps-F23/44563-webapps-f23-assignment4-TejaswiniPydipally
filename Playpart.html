        <h1>Tejaswini Pydipally acts in a play</h1>
        <h6> An Enemy of the People , by Henrik Ibsen</h6>
        <p> 
            
<h6 class = "Mrs. Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> A discovery of yours?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> A discovery of mine. <p class ="direction">[walks up and down.]</p> Just let them
come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
tell you!<br><br>

<h6 class = "Petra">Petra.</h6> But, father, tell us what it is.<br><br>
<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> Yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all
about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go
about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any
moles—<br><br>

<h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> What are you driving at, Doctor?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> <p class ="direction">[standing still by the table].</p> Isn't it the universal
opinion that our town is a healthy spot?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> Certainly.<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact—a place that
deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
invalids or for people who are well—<br><br>

<h6 class = "Mrs. Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> Yes, but my dear Thomas—<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> And we have been recommending it and praising it—I have
written and written, both in the "Messenger" and in pamphlets...<br><br>

<h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> Well, what then?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> And the Baths—we have called them the "main artery of
the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil
knows what else—<br><br>

<h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6> "The town's pulsating heart" was the expression I once used on
an important occasion.<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> Quite so. Well, do you know what they really are, these
great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money—do
you know what they are?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6> No, what are they?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Mrs. Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> Yes, what are they?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Dr. Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> The whole place is a pest-house!<br><br>

<h6 class = "Petra">Petra.</h6> The Baths, father?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Mrs. Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> <p class ="direction">[at the same time], Our Baths?<br><br>

<h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.<h6> But, Doctor—<br><br>

<h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6> Absolutely incredible!<br><br>
