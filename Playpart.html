Mrs. Stockmann. A discovery of yours?<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them
come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
tell you!<br><br>

Petra. But, father, tell us what it is.<br><br>
Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all
about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go
about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any
moles—<br><br>

Hovstad. What are you driving at, Doctor?<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann (standing still by the table). Isn't it the universal
opinion that our town is a healthy spot?<br><br>

Hovstad. Certainly.<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact—a place that
deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
invalids or for people who are well—<br><br>

Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but my dear Thomas—<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. And we have been recommending it and praising it—I have
written and written, both in the "Messenger" and in pamphlets...<br><br>

Hovstad. Well, what then?<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. And the Baths—we have called them the "main artery of
the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil
knows what else—<br><br>

Billing. "The town's pulsating heart" was the expression I once used on
an important occasion.<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. Well, do you know what they really are, these
great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money—do
you know what they are?<br><br>

Hovstad. No, what are they?<br><br>

Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, what are they?<br><br>

Dr. Stockmann. The whole place is a pest-house!<br><br>

Petra. The Baths, father?<br><br>

Mrs. Stockmann (at the same time), Our Baths?<br><br>

Hovstad. But, Doctor—<br><br>

Billing. Absolutely incredible!<br><br>
