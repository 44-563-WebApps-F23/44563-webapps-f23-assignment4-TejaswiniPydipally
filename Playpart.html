    <h1>Tejaswini Pydipally acts in a play</h1>
    <h6> An Enemy of the People , by Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p>

    <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">A discovery of yours?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">A discovery of mine.</p>
    <p class="direction">[walks up and down.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Just let them
        come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
        imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
        tell you!</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Petra">Petra.</h6>
    <p class="speech">But, father, tell us what it is.</p><br><br>
    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all
        about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go
        about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any
        moles—</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
    <p class="speech">What are you driving at, Doctor?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6>
    <p class="direction">[standing still by the table].</p>
    <p class="speech">Isn't it the universal
        opinion that our town is a healthy spot?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Certainly.</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact—a place that
        deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
        invalids or for people who are well—</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, but my dear Thomas—</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">And we have been recommending it and praising it—I have
        written and written, both in the "Messenger" and in pamphlets...</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well, what then?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">And the Baths—we have called them the "main artery of
        the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil
        knows what else—</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6>
    <p class="speech">"The town's pulsating heart" was the expression I once used on
        an important occasion.</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech"></p>Quite so. Well, do you know what they really are, these
    great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money—do
    you know what they are?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
    <p class="speech">No, what are they?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, what are they?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="DrStockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">The whole place is a pest-house!</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Petra">Petra.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> The Baths, father?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6>
    <p class="direction">[at the same time],
    <p class="speech">Our Baths?</p><br><br>

    <h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p class="speech">But, Doctor--</p> <br><br>

            <h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p class="speech">Absolutely incredible!</p><br><br>
            </p>
